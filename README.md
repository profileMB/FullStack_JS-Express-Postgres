## Setup for local deployment
If you want to deploy the site locally, here are the steps to follow :

#### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed :
- Yarn
- Node.js
- The PostgreSQL tool of your choice, either installed locally or accessible via a cloud service.

#### Initial setup
- Clone this repository to your desktop.
- Run `yarn install` to install all the dependencies.

#### Database setup
- Copy the SQL file 'tickets_DB' located in the 'database' directory.
- Import this SQL file and execute it using your preferred PostgreSQL tool to create the database structure.

#### Configure the environment variables
- Duplicate the '.env.example' file and rename the copy to '.env'.
- In this new '.env' file, replace the value of 'DB_URL' with your own PostgreSQL database connection string.
- Save and close the file.

#### Check your local adress
- Verify and adjust your local address for accessing the application. The default local address is 'http://localhost:3000'. If you are using a different port, make sure to replace '3000' with your specific port number.

#### Change the value of the 'backendServiceUrl' variable for local deployment
- Open the 'script.js' file in the 'public' directory.
- Comment out line 29 --> `// const backendServiceUrl = 'https://train-tickets-2023.onrender.com'`
- Uncomment line 30 --> `const backendServiceUrl = 'http://localhost:3000'`

#### Start the application
- Run `yarn start` from the project's root directory to start the application.
- Open your browser and go to 'http://localhost:3000' to test the application.
